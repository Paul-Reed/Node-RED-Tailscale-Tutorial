# Use https in your tailnet
Previously we have deactivated https inside Node-RED.  But since we want to access Node-RED again via https, we will now use the reverse proxy in the Tailscale agent to accomplish that.  Because it is much safer to handle all the security stuff in ***between*** Node-RED and the internet.  Indeed when the security would be handled ***inside*** Node-RED, hackers can abuse the power of Node-RED to disable its own security.

## Encrypted mesh network
The data between the Tailscale agents in your tailnet is already encrypted, using the Wireguard protocol.  As a result all you data will be send in a secure way between your virtual devices in your tailnet, across the internet.  Which means it is already safe enough to access Node-RED via ***plain http***, since all data is exchanged within your secure tailnet.

However it is still very useful to activate https, because the data is only encrypted ***between*** the Tailscale agents.  Data that you send into a Tailscale agent will be encrypted by that agent, and the data will be decrypted by the other agent that receives that encrypted data.  As a result if you send unencrypted data into your tailnet, it will leave your tailnet unencrypted.  What goes in will come out..

So the tailnet will simply pass your data transparent (without reading or changing the content), whether it is http or https traffic:

## Why use https
There are a few reasons why you should setup a ***https*** connection through the already encrypted tailnet (which will result in double encryption):
+ When you have very confidential data, and you donâ€™t trust that e.g. the Tailscale agents don't read the data (before encrypting it via Wireguard).
+ When the receiver expects https (based on signed certificates), like for example the Google Action Console servers (to receive voice commands from a Google Home device).
+ When web-push notifications are being used in the Node-RED dashboard, because modern browsers only allow such notifications when https is used (based on signed certificates like e.g. LetsEncrypt).
+ And so on ...

Anyway it is quite convenient if you can use https all over the place, even within your home network (i.e. within your LAN).

## Enable https in your tailnet
In the tabsheet *"DNS"* of your Tailscale admin console, you can enable https once for your entire tailnet:

<img src="https://github.com/bartbutenaers/Node-RED-security-basics/assets/14224149/07aa2e7d-546f-443a-9801-cf9cc51b3156" width="500">

When https is enabled, the control servers will inform all your Tailscale agents that they are allowed to setup https connections based on LetsEncrypt certificates.  Note that the agents won't start using https immediately, they just wait until they are told to do so (using the `tailscale serve ...` or `tailscale funnel ...` commands as explained further on).

## Use LetsEncrypt certificates
To setup a https connection to a local service (e.g. Node-RED), a certificate will be required.  Most users start by creating a ***self-signed certificate***, but they will soon realize that these certificates are nothing but trouble.  Indeed most systems (e.g. browsers, NodeJs, ...) don't trust such self-signed certificates, because even a hacker can create a self-signed certificate for your domain/hostname. 

A much better solution is to start using certificates for your domain/hostname, which are signed by a trusted certifcation authority (CA).  LetsEncrypt is a CA that offers certificated fully atomated and without any cost.  Most systems (e.g. browsers, NodeJs, ...) trust LetsEncrypt, so they accept such https connections.  Fortunately Tailscale agents can request LetsEncrypt certificates automatically (with common name the virtual hostname of the device in the tailnet).  

To generate a LetsEncrypt certificate on our Raspberry Pi (where Node-RED is running), you might tell the Tailscale agent explicit to generate a LetsEncrypt certificate, using the command `tailscale cert your-machine-name.your-tailnet-name.ts.net`.  However we will ***NOT*** do it like that.  Because it is even more easier to just tell the agent that you need a https connection on a specified port, and then the agent will automatically take care of everything:

Execute the following command to ***'serve'*** the local Node-RED service via https:
```
tailscale serve --https=9123 --bg --set-path / http://localhost:1880
```
Some explanation:
+ Listen to https requests on port 9123, and start https connection (so create and renew a LetsEncrypt certificate).
+ Run as a background (bg) job, to make sure it keeps running when the command shell window is closed.
+ The root path is e.g. `/`, but you can choose something else.
+ All requests will be forwarded to port 1880 on localhost.

That way you tell the reverse proxy (of the Tailscale agent on the Raspberry) to listen to port 9123 via a https server, and forward these as http requests to port 1880 on localhost.  The local (Node-RED) service will become this way ***only accessible within the tailnet*** via https.

Remarks:
+ The port 9123 is random unused port that I have choosen.
+ It is absolutely required to specify a port number, otherwise you cannot combine 'serve' and 'funnel' (see my [issue](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/11009#issuecomment-2267159080)).  You can specify whatever port number, but it should be one not used already.
+ Currently requests can only be forwarded to localhost, not to other hostnames.
+ Via `tailscale serve reset` it is possible to remove all serve's from the reverse proxy.
+ Via `tailscale serve status` you can get a list of all serve's that have been setup, but it will also show all funnels (which will be discussed later on).
+ Via the above command we serve a local service (i.e. webserver), however it is also possible to serve files and static texts on your tailnet easily.  This is possible via respectively a file server and a static text server, which are available within the Tailscale agent (see Tailscale [documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve)). 

## Check the certificate
Once the reverse proxy has been setup to use https, we can have a look at the certificate that is being used.

1. Navigate to Node-RED in the browser:
   ```
   https://your-machine-name.your-tailnet-name.ts.net:9123/dashboard
   ```
   Note that at port 1880 Node-RED is still accessible via http (as explained before in the 'plain http' section).
2. As soon as the browser shows in the address bar that the connection is safe, that already means that a valid LetsEncrypt certificate is being used.
3. Depending on the browser, there will be a menu option available to show the certificate being used.  Via that way you should be able to see the LetsEncrypt certificate for your virtual hostname.  For example in Chrome:

   ![image](https://github.com/bartbutenaers/Node-RED-security-basics/assets/14224149/e9772288-9ddd-4168-9635-fa816ed9cdbd)

## Behind the scenes
This section explains in detail what happens behind the scenes if a local service is being served:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b712d880-563d-4dbe-a921-f1cef4752df6)

1. Execute the `tailscale serve ...` command, to configure the reverse proxy inside the Tailscale agent.
2. The agent sends a request to the Tailscale Control servers, to get a LetsEncrypt certifcate (for the domain/hostname *"your-machine-name.your-tailnet-name.ts.net"*).
3. The Tailscale Control servers forward the request to the LetsEncrypt service, which will check if Tailscale owns the public domain *"your-machine-name.your-tailnet-name.ts.net"*.
   
   Remark: The Tailscale control servers will create a *.ts.net DNS TXT record for your subdomain, to complete their DNS-01 challenges for LetsEncrypt. 
4. Since that is the case (because tailscale owns all the subdomains of *.ts.net), the LetsEncrypt service will return a LetsEncrypt certificate to the Tailscale Control servers.
5. The Tailscale control servers forward the LetsEncrypt certificates to the Tailscale agent.
6. The Tailscale agent will store the certificate in the */var/lib/tailscale/certs* directory (on Linux), next to the corresponding private key file.
7. The Tailscale agent reverse proxy will load the LetsEncrypt certificate and private key, which it can use to setup SSL connections when a https request arrives.
8. When you navigate in your browser to the virtual hostname of the Raspberry Pi (https://your-machine-name.your-tailnet-name.ts.net:9123/dashboard), the Tailscale agent on your smartphone will intercept that request.
9. The DNS resolver of the agent will detect that it is a virtual Tailscale ip address or hostname, so it will forward the request to the Tailscale agent (on the Raspberry Pi) in your tailnet. 
10. The Tailscale agent listens to requests arriving via the Wireguard mesh network on port 4161 by default.  The agent will forward the https request to the port specified inside the request, in this case port 9123.
11. The reverse proxy will now execute 3 tasks:
     + Setup a https connection with the smartphone, based on the LetsEncrypt certificate.
     + Do SSL termination (i.e. convert the https requests to http requests) because we have specified in our serve command that the target is http.
     + Forward the http request to port 1880.  
12. Finally the plain http request will be forwarded to Node-RED, which will show the dashboard.

Since LetsEncrypt certificates only have a validity period of 3 months, the Tailscale agent will automatically ***renew*** these certificates periodically.  You can check that by looking at the date of the .crt file in the */var/lib/tailscale/certs* directory.

## SSL termination
Note that there are two kind of connections being used:
+ A https connection between the browser and the Tailscale agent on the Raspberry.  
+ A plain http connection between the agent and Node-RED.

It would be quite useles to setup a second https connection between the Tailscale agent (on the Raspberry) and Node-RED, because:
+ All the data traffic stays inside your own Raspberry.
+ If you have setup in the past https in Node-RED using a self-signed certificate, the Tailscale agent might even refuse to connect to Node-RED, because it doesn't trust that certificate.
