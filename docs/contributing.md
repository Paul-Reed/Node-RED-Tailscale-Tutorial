# Contributing

Contributing to this tutorial is fairly easy:

1. Create a fork (i.e. local copy) of this Github repository to your own Github account, by clicking on this button:

   If you had already created a fork of this repo in the past, you can bring it up-to-date with mine by clicking this button:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a66e12-1205-40e1-bcd8-79c1a2ad69cc)

   That way all changes - done in my repository meanwhile - will be synced to your forked repository.

2. Go to your own repositories in your own Github account, and open your fork of this repository.

3. Navigate to some of my md pages, and change some text via the pencil icon:

4. As soon as you have done all the necessary changes in this md file, you can save (i.e. commit) the changes by clicking this button:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc971c3-60a8-41d5-9d55-17cbf7ce2704)

5. Repeat this process for all md pages where you want to do changes.

6. As soon as all your changes are completed, go to the root of your forked repo (i.e. to the readme.md page) and click this button:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2089ef28-37cd-4122-8e4f-4b65ddace78d)

7. Then a popup dialog will appear that allows you to create a pull request, i.e. a request for me in my repository to review your changes:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a753a8d-9480-4e31-b538-508be0bacfeb)

8. The pull request will open so you can add a meaningful title, a description of your changes:

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eb09ccd-db77-4533-81bd-024a8dda6da2)

   Note that you can also see here all your updates highlighted in colours.

9. When you click the *"Create pull request"* button, your pull request will appear in my repository in the tabsheet *"Pull requests"*.

10. In the pull request we can discuss your changes, and when everything is fine I will merge your changes into my repository.
