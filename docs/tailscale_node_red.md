# Tailscale for Node-RED
Tailscale is a mesh network between the Tailscale agents, which need to be installed on all the devices that need to be part of the virtual network. This *'tailnet'* will find automatically its way through the firewall on your modem/router, so ***no*** need to open ports or setup port forwarding:

+ Each device in the tailnet has a virtual ip address 100.x.y.z and a virtual hostname, both of which are only known within your tailnet.  When you navigate to such a virtual hostname in the browser of your phone, the Tailscale agent on your phone will forward your request to the Tailscale agent running on the specified virtual hostname (in this case your Raspberry).  That way you can access your Node-RED flow editor and/or dashboard from your smartphone via the internet.
+ Next step is to allow the Google servers to send voice commands to the node-red-contrib-smarthome node.  Since there is no possibility to install a Tailscale client on the Google Actions Console servers, those servers will not be able to access devices within your tailnet.  However you can setup a secure encrypted tunnel (called *'funnel'*) from your Node-RED port 3001 to the worldwide cluster of Tailscale Funnel servers.  That way you can expose a local service on the internet via your tailnet.  Afterwards you need to change the fulfillment callback url on the Google Actions server, to refer to your exposed service on the Tailscale Funnel servers.
